      <p>
        Yes â€“ we rotate proxies and mimic human behavior to avoid detection. Our
        advanced system handles CAPTCHAs and respects Amazon's crawl delays to

        We can scrape prices as frequently as every 15 minutes for critical
        products, or on a daily/weekly basis depending on your needs. Our system
        adjusts request frequency to avoid triggering Amazon's anti-scraping

        While web scraping is generally legal, we comply with Amazon's Terms of
        Service by limiting request rates and only accessing publicly available
        data. We recommend using scraped data for market research and price
        comparison, not for direct commercial replication of Amazon's services.
